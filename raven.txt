Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
As of someone gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door
"'Tis some visitor," I added, "Rapping at my chamber door
"Only this, and nothing more."

Also: Battle Plans rarely survive the first main engagement with the enemy.
Just putting that out there. Anyway, back to the Raven...

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow, vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore
For that rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore
Nameless here forevermore


But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -
Till I scarcely more than muttered 'Other friends have flown before -
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'
Then the bird said, 'Nevermore.'

But the raven, never quitting, still is sitting--still is sitting
On that pallid bust of Pallas...
